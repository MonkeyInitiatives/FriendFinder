# FriendFinder

### Overview

This is a simple online matching quiz where a user answers a selection of 10 questions and is then matched with a friend in a database. The user is added into the database after submitting their survey so future users are able to be matched with them as well. There exists some simple text validation to check if all fields are filled out correctly.
